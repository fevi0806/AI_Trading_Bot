# 🚀 AI_Trading_Bot - Roadmap

## **🔹 Current Status**
We have completed **basic trade execution** and **market data collection**. Now, we are focusing on:
- **AI model training using reinforcement learning (PPO).**
- **Risk management implementation.**
- **Ensuring full backtesting capabilities before paper trading.**

## **🔹 Updated Phases (March 2025)**
### ✅ **Phase 1: Initial System Setup & Paper Trading**
✔️ Set up AI Trading Bot architecture.  
✔️ Establish communication via **ZMQ messaging**.  
✔️ Implement basic **strategy agent** with predefined rules.  
✔️ Configure **paper trading execution with IBKR**.  

### 🔄 **Phase 2: AI Model Training & Risk Management (Current Phase)**
🔹 Implement **self-learning AI model (PPO)** for **trade decision-making**.  
🔹 Introduce **risk management rules** (max drawdown, position sizing).  
🔹 Enhance **execution logic** to include risk-based adjustments.  
🔹 Ensure **full backtesting mode** before returning to paper trading.  

### 🔜 **Phase 3: Advanced Strategy Optimization & Paper Trading**
⏳ Optimize AI training performance based on backtesting.  
⏳ Conduct **paper trading with trained models** to verify accuracy.  

### 🔜 **Phase 4: Transition to Live Trading**
⏳ Fine-tune AI strategies.  
⏳ Deploy **live execution via IBKR API**.  
⏳ Implement **real-time monitoring & adaptive AI adjustments**.

📌 **Next Steps:**  
- Implement **risk-based trade execution logic**.  
- Train PPO models on **historical data with reinforcement learning**.  
- Log and validate model performance in backtesting mode.
