# AI Trading Bot - Project Tracking & Change Log

## **Tracking Methodology**
To ensure structured and efficient development, the following rules apply:
- ✅ **All changes must be documented before implementation.**
- ✅ **No modification is allowed without explicit approval and documentation.**
- ✅ **All phases, components, and dependencies are tracked continuously.**
- ✅ **Work is aligned strictly with the roadmap and project goals.**
- ✅ **Any deviation from the roadmap requires justification and approval.**

## **Current Issues & Fixes**
| Issue | Cause | Status | Fix Implemented |
|-------|-------|--------|----------------|
| **Execution Agent not receiving trade signals** | Incorrect ZeroMQ port mapping | 🔄 Fixing | Aligning ports in `comm_framework.py` |
| **Strategy Agent PPO model loading issue** | Incorrect file paths for ticker models | ✅ Fixed | Now loads `{ticker}_ppo.zip` correctly |
| **Data shape mismatch during historical training** | Incorrect column selection in `data_utils.py` | ✅ Fixed | Now correctly extracts `(50, 3)` shape |

---

## **Next Steps**
### 🔥 **Immediate Priorities**
1️⃣ **Fix Execution Agent trade signal reception** (Ensure proper port mapping)  
2️⃣ **Verify PPO model integration with historical data training**  
3️⃣ **Ensure all agents are properly aligned with the roadmap**  

### 📌 **Mid-Term Priorities**
✔ Implement full backtesting with historical market data  
✔ Enhance risk management logic before moving to live trading  
✔ Finalize trading strategy optimizations
